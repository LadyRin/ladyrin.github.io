I started learning programming at the age of 12, with the goal of creating mods for the video game Minecraft. Since then, I haven't stopped being interested in computers and programming. I have learned to use game engines like Unity to create game prototypes. Thanks to my studies, I have been able to deepen my knowledge in computer science and programming, in various fields such as web development, software development, database management, etc.",
