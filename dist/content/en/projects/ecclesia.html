        <div class="intro">
          <p>
            Ecclesia, named after the ancient Greek word for "assembly," is a web application that I
            developed as part of a Learning and Evaluation Situation (SAÃ‰) in my second year of my
            BUT. It is a democratic decision-making application that allows a group of people to ask
            open-ended questions, provide answers, and vote on the answers of others. The
            application was built using PHP and JavaScript, with a PostgreSQL database.
          </p>

          <p>
            The application is divided into four parts: the "questions" section, where a user can
            ask an open-ended question that needs to be approved by an administrator before being
            published; the "proposals" section, where users can respond to the questions if they
            belong to the group concerned by the question; the "votes" section, where users can vote
            for the proposals of others; and the "results" section, where the voting results are
            displayed.
          </p>

          <p>
            I developed this application as part of a group of four people. It was my first PHP
            project, and I learned a lot from it, both technically and in terms of project
            management. We used the agile method to manage the project and held regular meetings to
            track our progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            A demo of the site is available at this address (with randomly generated questions and
            proposals):
