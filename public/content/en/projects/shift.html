        <div class="intro">
          <p>
            Shift is a 2D platform video game, created with Unity during the 8th edition of the Code
            Game Jam. The theme of the jam was "Ethereal Legend", and we chose to create a platform
            game where the player can move between two dimensions, a "material" dimension and an
            "ethereal" dimension. The game was developed in 30 hours by a team of six people.
            <br />
            Our game won the grand prize of the Code Game Jam 2024, among 43 participating teams
            (and we are very proud of it!).
          </p>

          <p>
            The main mechanic of the game is the dimension shifting. The player can switch between
            the material dimension and the ethereal dimension at any time. In the material
            dimension, the physics are normal, and the player has a dash ability that allows them to
            move quickly. In the ethereal dimension, gravity is reduced, some platforms are not
            present, and the player can "swim" in areas of concentrated ether.
          </p>

          <p>
            My role in this project was to create the player controller and movement mechanics. I
            also worked on level management, camera control, and player respawn. Additionally, I
            worked on polishing the game by creating visual effects and adding post-processing.
